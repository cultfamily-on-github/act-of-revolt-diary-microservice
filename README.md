# Act Of Revolt Diary Microservice
This microservice might help CULTmanders &amp; Revolutionaries to support the CULT. It might be embedded in pages and magazines like the https://cultmagazine.org 

It might be cool to include infos from the [revoltapi](https://revoltapi.cultdao.io/static/proposals.json). Further it might be cool to combine the act of revolt diary with the [evidence links microservice](https://github.com/cultfamily-on-github/cult-evidence-links-microservice).

The idea is to give revolutionaries the chance document things like the following within a microservice.
